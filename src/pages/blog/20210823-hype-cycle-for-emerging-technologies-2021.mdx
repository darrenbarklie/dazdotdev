My more recent learnings about blockchain technologies have ignited a curiosity to understand what other technological innovations are potentially on the horizon.

Gartner annually publish **[The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle)**, with **[2021's](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-themes-surface-in-the-2021-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies/)** published on 23 August.

I thought it would be a fun exercise to caputre this and casually track each of the listed technologies, to better understand their potential and actual impact on the future.
