## Introduction

I've been tracking [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) for a while, as it seems to approach reactivity with better fundamentals than React, while framework author [Ryan Carniato](https://twitter.com/ryancarniato)'s enthusiasm and omnipresence for teaching and learning is infectious. To grasp the fundamentals, I've decided to transcribe _[Introduction to Reactivity with SolidJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70HXl1KhWE&ab_channel=SolidJS)_<Ref id="1" />, an introductory video demonstration of Solid, reactivity, and why you'd want to use it, by Solid core team member [Dan Jutan](https://twitter.com/jutanium).

## Maintaining Relationships

After creating a relationship between two values in JavaScript, changes to source values are not reflected in subsequent usage, which might seem unintuitive.

It is therefore necessary to restate the relationship in order to handle the most recently assigned value:

```javascript
// Init variable
let count = 2;

// Create a relationship
let doubleCount = count * 2;
console.log("First: " + doubleCount);
// => First: 4

// If we change `count`, the value of the
// relationship does not update
count++;
console.log("Second: " + doubleCount);
// => Second: 4

// For the relationship to hold, we have to
// restate the relationship
doubleCount = count * 2;
console.log("Third: " + doubleCount);
// => Third: 6
```

## Introducing Reactivity

Solid's signals <Ref id="2" /> are the cornerstone of reactivity. They contain values that are changeable over time, with all consumers of that value automatically updating in response to the base change.

```javascript
// Solid's reactivity can instead maintain
// that relationship over time, making it
// into a rule that's always true

// Instead of using `let` we will use `createSignal`
// from SolidJS to create a reactive variable
import {createSignal } from "solid-js";

// Signals give us two functions: a getter & a setter
// Pass in initial value as argument
// Return nameable getter and setter functions
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(2);

// Call the getter to access the variable value
let doubleCount = count() * 2;
console.log("Forth: " + doubleCount);
// => Forth: 4

// Signals allow us to tap in to Solid's reactivity

// Call getter() to access the value of variable
// Rather than `doubleCount2` being an assignment at
// a specific point-in-time, we write it as a
// function of the `count` signal
let doubleCount2 = () => count() * 2;
console.log("Fifth: " + doubleCount2());
// => Fifth: 4
```


## Creating Effects

To enact changes in response to updated signal values, we can use Solid's effects. <Ref id="3" /> As signals are trackable values, observers such as effects run a side effect dependant on signal value updates.

This makes reasoning about your code way easier, especially as complexity grows.

```javascript
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(2);

let doubleCount = () => count() * 2;

// Solid can maintain this relationship over time
// Test by updating count every second with `setInterval()`
// Use setter() to set reactive variable to value we pass
setInterval( () => {
  setCount(count() + 1)
}, 1000);

// An effect is a function that depends on signals
// With `createEffect()` we pass a function and Solid will
// track any signals that are used inside the function scope
// When any change is detected, the effect will rerun
createEffect(() => {
  console.log(doubleCount());
});
// => 4
// => 6
// => 8
// => ...
```

## Stacking Signals

When we introduce a second signal, with a different interval, it too is observed by the effect and handled accordingly. When either signal changes, the effect reruns.

```javascript
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

// Introduce a second signal
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(2);
const [multiplier, setMultiplier] = createSignal(3);

setInterval( () => {
  setCount(count() + 1)
}, 1000);

// Set a different interval on new signal
setInterval( () => {
  setMultiplier(multiplier() + 1)
}, 3000);

// Run basic inline arithmetic statement
createEffect(() => {
  console.log(`${count()} * ${multiplier()} = ${count() * multiplier()}`);
});
// => 2 * 3 = 6
// => 3 * 3 = 9
// => 4 * 3 = 12
// => 5 * 3 = 15
// => 5 * 4 = 20
// => 6 * 4 = 24
// => 7 * 4 = 28
// => 8 * 4 = 32
// => 8 * 5 = 40
// => ...
```

## Composable Systems

This system is composable — we can pull relationships out into their own functions.

```javascript
// Make our code neater by pulling out the calculation
const total = () => count() * multiplier();

// We can pass this around, call it with an effect
// Solid will know to look as deep as it needs to find
// any signals and rerun the effect when they change 
createEffect(console.log(`${count()} * ${multiplier()} = ${total()}`););
```

## Theory Behind Solid's Signals and Effects

[Video summary: 3:18 — 4:31](https://youtu.be/J70HXl1KhWE?t=198)

At the most basic level, `createSignal()` lets us read and write to a value.

```javascript
// pseudocode
export function createSignal(value) {

  const read = () => {
    return value;
  }

  const write = (nextValue) => {
    value = nextValue;
  };

  return [read, write];
}
```

In order for reactivity to work, we need a way to track any effect that observes the signal.

We'll maintain a global stack called `context`, which will let us track any effect that is currently running. A `getCurrentObserver()` function simply returns whatever is top of the stack.

```javascript
// pseudocode
const context = [];

function getCurrentObserver() {
  return context[context.length -1];
}
```

We ensure that this `context` is kept up to date. In `createEffect()`, we take a function and create a wrapper around it.

The wrapper pushes itself onto the `context` stack, executes the function that was passed, and removes itself from the stack once it's done:

```javascript 
// pseudocode
const context = [];

function getCurrentObserver() {
  return context[context.length -1];
}

export function createEffect(fn) {
  const execute = () => {
    context.push(execute);
    try {
      fn();
    } finally {
      context.pop();
    }
  };

  execute();
}
```

With this system in place, when a signal is read, it can call `getCurrentObserver()` to check if it is running inside an effect.

Then it can grab a reference to that effect and add it to it's subscriber list.

Then when we write to the signal, it can go and rerun all of those subscribers.

```javascript
// pseudocode
export function createSignal(value) {
  // Contains all effects references
  const subscribers = new Set();

  const read = () => {
    // Check if running inside an effect
    const current = getCurrentObserver();
    // If so, add to subscriber list
    if (current) subscribers.add(current); 
    return value;
  }

  const write = (nextValue) => {
    value = nextValue;
    // Rerun all subscribing effects
    for (const subscriber of subscribers) {
      subscriber(); 
    }
  };

  return [read, write];
}
```

## Summary

While a simplified explanation, this subscription method is at the core of how Solid works.

- **`createSignal()`** tracks a reactive value, via getter & setter functions
- **`createEffect()`** stays up to date by rerunning on observed signal changes
- Functions can represent relationships between signals for powerful system modelling
