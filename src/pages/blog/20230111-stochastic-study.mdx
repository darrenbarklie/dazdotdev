Today I learned the word __stochastic__ from reading the OpenAI documentation.<Ref id="1" />

Since the ChatGPT beta launched publicly, I have kept returning to it, sometimes just to play and other times to actually help me produce content.  As a business owner I have to wear so many hats and one of my least favourite is "marketer/copywriter". While I earnestly enjoy writing notes for study, producing technical documentation, communicating concisely, or writing records for myself, there's something about "copywriting" that I just don't enjoy. 

While I respect good writing as an art form, _content-production_ feels more like a digital hack job. It seems so formulaic that it itches my developer-mind as something prime for automation.  Now ChatGPT allows me to do just that.

But I keep going back to it for more; to summarise content consumption, to narrow options for accelerated decision-making, and to explore topics in a way that is more organically curious and earnestly conversational than pouring through search results and consuming Wikipedia articles ever can.

Now it's time to build. I don't know the destination just yet, but I've started taking my first steps today.
