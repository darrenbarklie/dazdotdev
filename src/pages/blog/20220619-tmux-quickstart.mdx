**Terminal multiplexers are applications described as offering a single management pane that allows control and maintenance over multiple terminal sessions.**

[Tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer) initially released in 2007 and is the original open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. As well as command-line program management, it can also detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible.

## Installation

Full instructions are available from the [tmux GitHub README](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started).

For Mac users, using homebrew, it's a single, simple command:

```bash
brew install tmux
```

## Up & Running

Running the program is as you might expect:

```bash
tmux
```

You should find yourself in a new terminal environment. At this moment, not too much differs from a default terminal session, but do note the new control panel on the bottom edge.

### Mac OSX iTerm/Tmux Backspace Fault

Should you also encounter a glitch with the backspace functionality not correctly removing characters, consider the guidance offered in this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68456561/11698046). The gist is to run these commands to extend the base configuration:

```bash
curl -LO https://invisible-island.net/datafiles/current/terminfo.src.gz && gunzip terminfo.src.gz

sudo /usr/bin/tic -xe tmux-256color terminfo.src
```

## Commands

```

# Start tmux
tmux

# New pane
Ctrl + b, % (vertical split)
Ctrl + b, " (horizontal split)

# Switch pane
Ctrl + b, [arrow key]

# Close pane
exit



# Create window
Ctrl + b, c

# Switch window
Ctrl + b, [number]

# Rename window
Ctrl + b, ,



# List current sessions
tmux ls

# Create new session
tmux new -s [session-name]

# Reattach to a session
tmux attach -t [session-name]

# Rename a session
tmux rename-session -t [session-name-old] [session-name-new]

# Detach a session
Ctrl + b, d

# Kill a session
tmux kill-session -t [session-name]



# Scroll through log
Ctrl + b, [

# Quit scroll
q

# Enter copy mode
Ctrl + b, PgUp

```
