Enjoying my first listen of [Kid A Mnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_A_Mnesia) this morning and found a related topic on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29127601). American composer [Paul Lansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lansky) received a Ph.D. in music from Princeton in 1973. He served on the Princeton University faculty from 1969 until retirement in 2014.

In a [blog article](http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/radiohead.ml.html), Paul shares how [Radiohead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead) approached him to sample from his first computer composition _mild und leise_.

The full [MP3 is hosted](http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/mild_und_leise.mp3) online. The raw sample is immediately recognisable and sure to thrill any Radiohead fan.

A _HN_ commenter points to an equally intriguing showcase of sampling in Daft Punk's _One More Time,_ credit to [@NehhLmao's tweet](https://twitter.com/nehhlmao/status/1363925150958317568).
