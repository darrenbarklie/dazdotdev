**The financial crisis of 2008 cost the global economy trillions of dollars of value and irreversibly destroyed public trust in the proprietors of the financial system.** Itâ€™s no coincidence that a new paradigm was simultaneously set in motion; with Satoshi Nakamoto publishing a paper that founded Bitcoin and defined the foundations of blockchain technologies.

**[Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto)** is a pseudonym for the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, who actively worked on the project from 2008 to 2010. He (she, or they) introduced Bitcoin via a post to the Metzger, Dowdeswell & Co. LLC cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com entitled **[Bitcoin v0.1 released](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html)**.

The 2008 whitepaper **[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** details how peer-to-peer networks are utilised to prevent the double-spend problem. The bitcoin software was open-sourced at **[github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)** a year later in 2009.

Throughout the years, claims of Satoshi's real-life persona and location have spanned multiple persons and continents, yet all ultimately remaining inconclusive.

With communications from Satoshi demonstrating high-level competency across cryptography, computing, economics and psychology, there is weight to the theory of Satoshi Nakamoto actually representing a collective of individuals.

As the project founder, Satoshi is believed to still retain 980,000 bitcoins, at a present-day value of nearly $55 billion USD, although even this remains widely speculated.
