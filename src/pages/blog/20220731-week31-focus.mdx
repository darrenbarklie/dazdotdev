My first week of August is stacked with three import milestones. By planning in advance, taking time to capture work in progress, and later reflecting upon actual execution as a series of short blog posts, I am hoping for three things:

- **Accountability**: these deliverables are important to me. While they feel like a stretch, they seem achievable with organisation, consistency and persistence. By introducing a little public accountability I'm amplifying my attention and focus.
- **Organisation**: three relatable but different disciplines, requiring not only considerable personal contribution, but also considerable cooperation and coordination with colleagues, customers and the community.
- **Success**: as my business and responsibilities grow, so do the challenges. I must match up in order to progress.

## Targets

What do I actually want to achieve next week?
