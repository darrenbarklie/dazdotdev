Took ill and was bed-ridden for most of the day.

Horrendously intense fever gripped me and stole my energy. Tested negative for COVID, thankfully, but little consolation given my current condition.

Unintentionally chained together a downbeat celebration of artists that left too soon (yes, even Lemmy left too soon ...I expected that dude to live _forever_).
