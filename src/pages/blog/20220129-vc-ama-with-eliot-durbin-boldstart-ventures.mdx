**Eliot Durbin serves as General Partner at boldstart ventures, currently splitting his time between Miami and NYC. With a professional career starting from his teenage years, successfully exiting his first company 2 years after leaving school, VC was a nature calling for the tech enthusiast.**

[A conversation](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/from-idea-to-product) on the topic of raising finance was hosted by **Ali Goldstein Norup**, the Head of VC & Startup Ecosystem in America for Google Cloud. While I’m certain that this “AMA”, was pre-recorded, making the format feel a little forced, the fast-paced conversation did deliver a load of value.

Below follows my notes of key soundbites from the discussion. I’m not going to labour everything in to a prose, for I think that the key takeaways should be easily digestible.

It was reassuring to have so many of my personal understandings reframed or validated by such experienced engineers and business builders. I left the conversation optimistic with ideas and ambitions...

## Takeaways

Your pitch should be: **“I build this prototype and got 10 users”.**

Be patient in seeking an investor that understands what you are doing and gives you time to figure things out. They should help you discover **Options** and find **Leverage**.

### What are the signals for when you are a ready to scale?

- Founder should be pinned to back of the seat
- Core team should all be pinned to back of the seat
- Two modes when starting up:
    1. Building first version
    2. Building tools for scaling
- Day 0 is User narratives and dashboards, **not** a Company
- Always “Product First”

### What should the early culture be at a startup?

- “Culture of demo” - even if it’s not real or doesn’t work, produce the idea
- Always listen: Users will feedback and tell you how to bring a product to market
- Get the User right first, then translate that into a Budget
- “It’s the Total Addressable Market (TAM) you exit with, not the TAM you start with”
- Investment allows startups to hire a team (and reach better hires earlier)

### How should my startup make an early impact?

- Create effective messaging
- Excite with new category creation/category disruption
- Build a community and culture around the startup
- Find focused folks to help with specific problems
- Get going early into the ecosystem
- “Nail it then scale it” — avoid premature scaling in wrong direction
- Tailor your language: Instead of “Marketplace for space”, simplify: “Rent out your spare room” for best effect

### How should my startup be operating?

- Live and feel the pain point in order to experience user empathy
- Customer obsession until they would desperately miss if you disappear
- Get to what matters really quickly
- Act fast with either a “Fast No” or “Fast Yes” — no prolonged meetings
- Generate failures and tests in advance, with “Robots as a Service”

### How do I financing my scaling startup?

- Best resource is someone who has first-hand experience: find a founder who has already raised
- Money can solve demand, but evidence reaching that demand before seeking money
- Non-obvious businesses can be difficult to raise for - can take a long time to reach marketplace acceptance (5+ seed rounds over many years)

### Where should I focus new ideas?

- New sectors that are here to stay: Remote work, distributed teams, video conferencing, etc.
