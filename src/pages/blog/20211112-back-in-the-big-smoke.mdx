Great to be back in the big city, where there's an energy and attitude that I just can't find at home.

I unexpectedly extended my stay in London for an extra night (AKA I missed my flight) and took the opportppunity to catch up with some of my favourite Vietnamese dishes from an authentic restaurant in Soho called [Viet](http://www.vietsoho.co.uk/).

Really enjoyed old favourites _bún thịt nướng_ followed by a bowl of _phở bò_. It wasn't entirely necessary to eat two mains, but I couldn't resist.

Was fun to chat a little Vietnamese with the friendly staff too. Looking forward to returning on my next trip.
