I'm sat with a huge grin on my face right now, despite less than one hour of sleep in forty and a squadron of mosquitoes feasting on me with vigour. I'm writing this at 6am, sat outside Hanoi International Airport, basking in my first minutes back in Việt Nam in four years.

I'm glad to be returning with confidence and excitement for the weeks ahead. I'm excited for catching up with old friends, making new friends, and filling my time with some productive fun. While I have some big milestones ahead and plenty to keep coordinated, it feels great to be stretching those nomadic muscles again!

While of this is exciting, my immediate priority should be catching up on some sleep!
