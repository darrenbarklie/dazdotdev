## Aside

I've been drifting quite a bit recently. Not necessarily lazy, but not exactly taking great strides in any particular direction either. Truthfully I'm frustrated by being boxed into a perpetual "twilight zone" of professional progress of late.

Lacking real influence on the scenario, I'm on pause; perpetually on the cusp of a massive professional milestone, but ever-presently just dwelling, dwindling and drained. I'm beginning to ponder the [sunken cost fallacy](https://time.com/5347133/sunk-cost-fallacy-decisions/).

I need to keep things steady for the next couple of months and then see how the new year is poised before making decisions.
