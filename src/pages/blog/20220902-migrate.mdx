[Astro](https://astro.build/) came to my attention shortly before it reached it reached it's [v1.0 release](https://astro.build/blog/astro-1/) on 9 August. Growing tired of the overhead of managing a WordPress site for simple static content, I began considering the options for something leaner.

While I am a fairly seasoned [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) developer, authoring a theme in PHP, manually handling CI/CD setup, managing a database and relying upon plugins seemed all too cumbersome to match the spirit of this blog. I want the agility, versatility and speed befitting of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
